A 360 EGOCENTRIC KINETIC HUMAN ACTIVITY VIDEO DATASET

    Abstract:
    
    Recently, there has been a growing interest in wearable sensors which provides new research perspectives 
    for 360° video analysis. However, the lack of 360° datasets in literature hinders the research in this 
    field. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a novel Egocentric (first-person) 360° Kinetic human 
    activity video dataset (EgoK360). The EgoK360 dataset contains annotations of human activity with different 
    sub-actions, e.g., activity Ping-Pong with four sub-actions which are pickup-ball, hit, bounce-ball and serve. 
    To the best of our knowledge, EgoK360 is the first dataset in the domain of first-person activity recognition 
    with a 360° environmental setup, which will facilitate the egocentric 360° video understanding. 
    We provide experimental results and comprehensive analysis of variants of the two-stream network for 360 
    egocentric activity recognition.
